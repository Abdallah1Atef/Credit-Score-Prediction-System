## Project Overview

This project implements a credit score prediction system that classifies customers into three categories:
- **Good**: Excellent creditworthiness
- **Standard**: Average creditworthiness
- **Poor**: High-risk credit profile

The system uses a sophisticated data preprocessing pipeline and SVM models with hyperparameter tuning through GridSearchCV.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handles missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies
  - Specialized transformers for credit history age conversion
  - Advanced categorical encoding (ordinal + one-hot)
  
- **Model Training**:
  - SVM classifier with PCA dimensionality reduction
  - GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization
  - Feature selection based on ANOVA and correlation analysis

- **Streamlit Web App**:
  - Single prediction interface with form inputs
  - Batch prediction via CSV upload
  - Interactive visualization of results
  - Credit improvement tips

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Launch the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
The app will launch in your default browser at http://localhost:8501

Using the Prediction System
Single Prediction:

Fill out the form in the sidebar

Click "Predict Credit Score"
**Output Interpretation**
Credit Score	Color Code	Description
- Good	    🟢 Green	Excellent creditworthiness
- Standard	🟡 Yellow	Average credit profile
- Poor	    🔴 Red	High-risk borrower

Batch Prediction:

Upload a CSV file with customer data

Download the predictions as CSV

Data Pipeline
The preprocessing pipeline includes these key transformations:

Credit History Age Conversion:

Converts strings like "5 Years and 3 Months" to total months

**Numeric Cleaning:**

- Removes special characters from numeric fields

- Handles outliers using IQR method

**Categorical Processing:**

- Standardizes category strings

- Imputes missing values using group modes

**Mixed encoding (label rof ordinal features + one-hot for nominal features )**

**Feature Selection:**

- Selects top features based on ANOVA F-values

- Removes highly correlated features

- Scaling & Dimensionality Reduction:

- StandardScaler for normalization

- PCA for feature reduction

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Key insights from the EDA:

**Class Distribution:**

- Standard: 53.2%

- Poor: 31.4%

- Good: 15.4%

**Important Correlations:**

- Credit_History_Age ↔ Credit_Score (0.37)

- Interest_Rate ↔ Credit_Score (-0.48)

- Outstanding_Debt ↔ Credit_Score (-0.39)

**Visualizations:**

- Distribution plots for all numeric features

- Correlation heatmap

- Boxplots showing relationships between features and credit score
